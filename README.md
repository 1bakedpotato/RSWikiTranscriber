This is a WIP RuneApps app for transcribing RuneScape dialogue in the format used by the RuneScape Wiki.

1. Clone or download this repository.
1. If you downloaded it as a zip file, extract the files somewhere you'll remember.
1. Open the appconfig.json file.
1. Replace the file paths after "appUrl" and "configUrl" with the paths to the transcriber2.html and appconfig.json files on your computer.
1. Open Alt1, and open the Alt1 browser (by opening the Alt1 Toolkit menu, then clicking Browser)
1. Paste the appUrl into the browser's address bar
1. Click the Add App button in the upper right corner.
